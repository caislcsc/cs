CAISL Computer Science Club for year 2016/2017
======================================

Hi! Welcome to the Computer Science Club. In this afterschool activity we teach various courses, some of which include game development, cyber security, and mathematics simulations. We are also a friendly place that can help you improve your programming skills. Below you can find information to orient yourself and challenges to solve!

What do we teach?
 * Programming. Sessions will be taught using Java, Javascript, and maybe some Python; but you may use whatever language you'd like!
 
 * Using useful online development platforms such as GitHub. Each person is free to use whichever IDE they are most comfortable with!
 
 * Introduction to Cyber Security: A course that comprises the very basics of cybersecurity: Encryption, codebreaking, vulnerabilities,    and basic pentesting. On of this course's objectives is to make you think about a problem before diving into coding.
 
 * Technical Computer Science: This is a course that aims to help develop understanding in the basics of Technical Computer Science,        ranging from data types and components of computers to advanced data structures, searching, sorting, and parsing algorithms,            computational mathematics, and O Notation. The final project for this unit is: [Create an interpreter for a made up simple language?]
 
 * Game Development and Visual Learning: This course will be taught mainly in JavaScript, and it is divided in several sections. [INSERT    DESCRIPTION HERE @matiasilva, and other information on the sections]. This includes more advanced development techniques using          Threads, which will be taught in Java. The final project for this unit is: [Maybe make a simple 2D Game Engine or make a 2D Game]
 
 * We also have a section on problem solving, that is designed for you to improve your problem solving skills. Problems are usually        divided into three Dificulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. They'll give you 1, 2, or 3 points respectively. You are to do these        problems at home, or not do them, it's up to you; but the more you practice, the better you'll be!
   The solutions should be put on your github, and you should submit a link to it on a google forms. We will then check that it works,      and get back to you as soon as possible!
 
 **Most of these units will have a Final Project that you will present to the rest of the club members. Let your creativity out!**

This repository contains:

  * Good examples of Projects from Students.
  * Example code to supplement each session.
  * Syllabi for courses [I feel like this should not be here. Github should be more oriented to source code.].
  * Additional projects and source code.
  
Current Syllabus: __Creative Coding and Game Development I, Processing and p5.js: Creative Coding for the Visual Learners__
