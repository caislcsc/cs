CAISL Computer Science Club 2016/2017
======================================

Hi! Welcome to the Computer Science Club. In this afterschool activity we teach various courses, some of which include game development, cyber security, and mathematics simulations. We are also a friendly place that can help you improve your programming skills. Below you can find information to orient yourself and challenges to solve!

What do we teach?
 * Programming. Sessions will be taught using Java, Javascript, and maybe some Python; but you may use whatever language you'd like!
 
 * Using useful online development platforms and tools such as GitHub.
 
 * Introduction to Cyber Security
   * Encryption, codebreaking, vulnerabilities, and basic pentesting
   * Learning about the Web and its structure
   * Familiarizing yourself with the Web's languages
 
 * Technical Computer Science
   * Defining important terms
   * Learning about the development of the computer
 
 * Creative Coding & Visual Learning: Processing and p5.js
   * Game Development
   * Using rendering engines
   * Integrating physics into simulations
   * Visualizing mathematics and science algorithms
 
 * Coding Challenges & Problem Solving
   * Using critical thinking and analytical skills
   * Experimenting with creativity
   
 *To read more about each course, find its repository's readme.*
 
 **Most of these units will have a Final Project that you will present to the rest of the club members. Let your creativity out!**

This repository contains:

  * Good examples of Projects from Students.
  * Example code to supplement sessions.
  * Additional projects and source code.
  
Current Syllabus: __Creative Coding and Game Development I, Processing and p5.js: Creative Coding for the Visual Learners__
