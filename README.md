Lisbon-Sintra Computer Science Club 2017/2018
======================================

Current Syllabus: __Creative Coding and Game Development I, Processing and p5.js: Creative Coding for the Visual Learners__

Welcome to the Computer Science Club. We're glad that you're interested in learning more about the technology that is changing our world. The material we cover/teach will depend highly on what you want or need. To begin the year, we'll start with Processing, a Java development environment that makes visual coding a piece of cake! You are also welcome to help others or receive help with classes/projects.

What do we teach?
 * Programming. Sessions will be taught using Java, Javascript, and maybe some Python; but you may use whatever language you'd like!
 
 * Using useful online development platforms and tools such as GitHub.
 
 * Introduction to Cyber Security
   * Encryption, codebreaking, vulnerabilities, and basic pentesting
   * Learning about the Web and its structure
   * Familiarizing yourself with the Web's languages
 
 * Technical Computer Science
   * Defining important terms
   * Learning about the development of the computer
 
 * Creative Coding & Visual Learning: Processing and p5.js
   * Game Development
   * Using rendering engines
   * Integrating physics into simulations
   * Visualizing mathematics and science algorithms
 
 * Coding Challenges & Problem Solving
